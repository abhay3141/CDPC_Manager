# CDPC_Manager

Tech Stack for Backend : Django
Run in the command line after activating the given virtual env : python manage.py runserver 

Super User
email: cdpc@iitrpr.ac.in
pw: abhay

for other roles you can add yourself as well as dummy ids have been created which can be seen with this admin view.

Future Modifications:
*  We will add in app notification/email part 
*  Record for each placement session
*  Add password update feature as well
*  For now to add another super user one need to do it by backend, so in future will add that feature too.

Couldn't do all due to internship :)
Most of the asked actions for each role have been completed.
